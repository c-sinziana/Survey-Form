An only desktop web page with basic HTML and embedded CSS, part of the FreeCodeCamp projects.

## Personal notes 

This was my first project to learn the basics of a web page structure. 

I searched for HTML and CSS documentation and made sure that all the tests of the script were passing.

The most difficult part was figuring out CSS and, as you could see, I used it as little as possible and focused only on the structure, because styling the page wasn't a requirement.
